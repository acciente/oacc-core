OACC Java Application Security Framework
========================================

## What is OACC?

OACC - pronounced _[oak]_ - is a fully featured API to both **enforce** and **manage** your application's authentication and authorization needs.

In a nutshell, OACC provides _permission-based_ authorization services and allows your application to enforce security by answering the question:

    Is entity 'A' allowed to perform action 'p' on entity 'B'?

## Features

- **Fully implemented API**  
All the functionality to manage your application's security model, out of the box.

- **Single access-control paradigm**  
Always operate at the resource level. Manage permissions exclusively between resources.

- **Flexible security model**  
Secure any operation between your domain objects and the actors on them.

- **Permission delegation**  
Authorize subjects to delegate their permissions to others with _GRANT OPTIONS_.

- **Identity delegation**  
Authorize an authenticated subject to securely "impersonate" another subject.

- **Efficient query methods**  
Find resources by permission with efficient symmetric query methods.

## Get Started

The easiest way to include the latest OACC release into your project is to declare the following Maven coordinates as a dependency in your POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.acciente.oacc</groupId>
    <artifactId>acciente-oacc</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-rc.7</version>
</dependency>
```

To _install, configure and initialize_ the **OACC database**, please refer to the [Get Started Tutorial](http://oaccframework.org/getting-started-tutorial.html) on the project website.

The [_SecureTodo_ sample application](http://oaccframework.org/secure-todo-example.html) illustrates how to integrate OACC into a Java application and how to address several real-world authorization scenarios. The writeup is also available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/acciente/oacc-example-securetodo) that contains the full source code.
