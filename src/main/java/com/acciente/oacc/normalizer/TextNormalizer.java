/**
 * Normalizes Unicode text to handle characters that have more than one canonically equivalent representation.
 * <p>
 * This is important when comparing hashed passwords because plaintext that visually looks the same might actually
 * be represented differently binarily, without the user being aware. For example, `Ã©` (the letter `e` with accent acute)
 * may be represented as a single Unicode character (U+00E9) or composed of two characters (U+0065 + U+0301), but both
 * representations are canonically equivalent.
 * <p>
 * This class first tries to use the ICU4J library for normalization because it normalizes character arrays
 * without converting to <code>String</code>. If ICU4J is not available, then it falls back to the text normalizer
 * provided by the JDK, which produces an **intermediate <code>String</code> representation** of the text.
 * <p>
 * In other words, if you need to prevent a cleanable <code>char[]</code> password being turned into a temporary
 * <code>String</code> during Unicode character normalization, you need to include a dependency to ICU4J.
